SCENARIO_NAME: Civil Drafting vs Mechanical Drafting and Manufacturing Technician Certification

MODE: selection

SCENARIO_DESCRIPTION:
Student in vocational rehabilitation completing a drafting 
certification program. Originally enrolled in Civil Drafting 
but switched to Mechanical Drafting. Plans to stack a 
Manufacturing Technician certification on top of the 
Mechanical Drafting credential. Converting the certification 
into an Engineering Technology associates degree is the 
long-term academic path.

Background includes 10+ years enterprise technology experience
across Apple iCloud, Virtustream, Isilon, SCADA, and CCaaS.
Simultaneously building Xybernetex Systems LLC, a decision 
infrastructure platform. Strong interest in IoT, Industry 4.0,
PLC programming, and OT networking. Goal is to position at 
the intersection of CAD design, manufacturing knowledge, and 
cybernetic systems — bridging physical and digital layers.

Civil Drafting has a stronger immediate job market, more 
established hiring pipelines, and lower barrier to entry 
employment. Mechanical Drafting combined with Manufacturing 
Technician certification is more intellectually compelling, 
broader in application outside pure drafting, and directly 
connects to industrial automation, IoT, and OT networking 
which align with founder's technology background.

DIMENSIONS:
- Job market strength and hiring pipeline depth
- Alignment with existing technology background
- Breadth of application outside pure drafting roles
- Connection to IoT and industrial automation career path
- Intellectual engagement and long-term motivation
- Compatibility with Xybernetex Systems LLC trajectory
- Time to first employment opportunity

CONSTRAINTS:
- Must be completable within vocational rehabilitation program
- Must produce employment options if Xybernetex funding delayed
- Must not require starting over academically
- Must be defensible as a credential stack to employers
- Should position toward Industry 4.0 and OT networking
- Must maintain motivation through completion
