SCENARIO_NAME: Municipal Bridge Replacement — Cedar Falls

SCENARIO_DESCRIPTION:
Cedar Falls (pop. 340,000) has three aging bridges requiring significant intervention
within 18 months. The city has secured $48M in federal infrastructure funding but full
replacement of all three costs $71M. The city cannot issue new bonds — voter approval
failed in November. One bridge must receive only a patch repair, deferring full
replacement by 4-10 years depending on the structure.

Bridge 1 — Commerce Viaduct: Carries 28,000 vehicles/day including the primary freight
route for the industrial district. Structural rating: 4/10. Full replacement: $26M.
Patch repair: $6M, buys 4-6 years. Catastrophic failure would cut off the industrial
district entirely.

Bridge 2 — Eastside Connector: Primary access for the city's lowest-income neighborhood
(pop. 62,000). Structural rating: 5/10. Full replacement: $22M. Patch repair: $4M,
buys 6-8 years. No alternative route — closure forces a 40-minute detour to downtown
employment centers.

Bridge 3 — Lakeside Pedestrian Bridge: Tourist and active transportation corridor.
Structural rating: 6/10. Full replacement: $23M. Patch repair: $3M, buys 8-10 years.
Vocal advocacy group has City Council support.

City Engineer wants to replace Commerce Viaduct — highest structural risk, catastrophic
failure potential. Mayor wants to protect Eastside Connector — election is 14 months
away. Chamber of Commerce backs Commerce Viaduct. Equity coalition is threatening
litigation if Eastside is deferred. Pedestrian bridge advocates control three Council votes.
